  <h2>Sunseeker 2010</h2>
  <p>The 2010 car is the most recent solar car produced by the team. It was completed in 2010, and is the primary vehicle used by the team for races and other public events. It has competed in three American Solar Challenge and five Formula Sun Grand Prix races since its debut.</p>
  <p>The car is not likely to compete in any future races due to its age and new regulations making it more costly to maintain.</p>
