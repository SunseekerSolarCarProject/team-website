Their goal: to enhance our understanding of renewable energy and to make renewable energy sources more viable for powering the future. This same goal is in mind when the current generation of Sunseekers sets out to do the same. <br><br>We have participated in all of the American Solar Challenge races since they began over 20 years ago. Throughout the years, we have rayced with various cars, all of which have been designed and built by students at Western Michigan University."

The event is typically held every other year during the summer and is open to solar car teams from countries all over the world. The routes have varied greatly over the course of the event’s rich history, but they are always designed to provide teams with a great opportunity to demonstrate their solar cars under real world driving conditions and thoroughly test the reliability of all onboard systems. <br><br>More about the American Solar Challenge can be found on its official website, including results from past events.",

From the northern city of Darwin, to the southern city of Adelaide, the WSC takes teams through the Australian Outback on a journey of about 3,000 kilometers, or just under 1,900 miles. This challenge is the pinnacle of solar car racing."
